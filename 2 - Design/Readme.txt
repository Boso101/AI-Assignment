What goes here?

A Technical Design Document containing the following information:

○ The pathfinding algorithm you will implement
○ AI strategies for NPCs for the game design that are technically feasible, respond to 
the brief, and provide creative solutions to all design issues
○ The scope of work to be produced
○ The system features, functionality, and constraints of the target platform
○ A description of your simulation or game, including the behaviour of all actors
○ A description of the state machine (or other NPC decision algorithm) used. This may 
take the form of a diagram (in a format appropriate to the algorithm described)
○ The user interface controls
○ Positive and negative feedback to user interaction
(If the simulation is non-interactive, a description of all feedback generated)
○ Sequencing of difficulty levels, if required
○ Schedule of major milestones, including communication process and frequency of 
communication with client
○ Assessment of production risks
○ Pre-existing components (assets, libraries, and algorithms) to be used, including an Copyright © AIE 2021 8 | PAGE
evaluation of each component’s functionality, suitability, and technical impact on the 
project
